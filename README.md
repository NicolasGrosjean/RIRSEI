# Rex in regno suo est imperator

> Historical enhancement mod for CK2

Rex in regno suo est imperator (RIRSEI) is a mod based on a deep overhaul of imperial mechanics in the christian world (catholic and orthodox).
The aim of the mod is to increase greatly the historicity of the vanilla game, while deepening the uchronic options but whose intentions and ideas are rooted in historical reality.
It's recommended for historical accuracy fans, especially in late game.
On the other hand, several kingdoms now have unique and dynamic scripts around the imperial dynamics.
This mod has been worked for both the date of 867 and 1066. So I hope you'll enjoy this mod.

This mod was created by Faras on the [Mundus Bellicus forum](http://www.mundusbellicus.fr/forum/grande-strat%C3%A9gie/crusader-kings-ii/mods-modding-af/rex-in-regno-suo-est-imperator).
This mod is presented in English on the [Paradox forum](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/mod-rex-in-regno-suo-est-imperator-historical-overhaul.781434/).
The objective of this repository is to help him to maintain his mod over patches.

### Commits & Pull Requests

As we use GitHub, some guidelines are needed. Therefore, we would like to ask you the following: 
- Before making any new commit to master, please check your code (either by using the [Validator](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?597480-The-Validator-Find-errors-quickly-and-with-minimal-pain!/page75), or reading it through) in order to avoid any issues.
- If you are doing any change to the mod (major or minor), please add a mention to it in [ChangeLog.txt](ChangeLog.txt), in order for us to easier make public releases and keep track of changes. 
It is better to have a too full changelog rather than a one that is incomplete.
